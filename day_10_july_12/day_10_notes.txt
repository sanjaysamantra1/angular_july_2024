Functions 
=========
-function is a block of code/statements designed to perform a particular task.
-function is executed only when that gets invoked/called.

Type:
1. Pre-Defined / in-built (console.log(),document.write(), Math.max())
2. user-defined 


a. Function Declaration (Named Function)
b. Function Expression  (anonymous)
c. IIFE/Self-Invoked   (Immediately invoked function expression)
d. Arrow Function


Arrow Function
==============
-Less code
-Implicit return


How 'this' works in normal & arrow function
===========================================
-Normal 
    a. 'this' is dynamic 
    b. this = how the function is called , from where the function is called
-Arrow
    a. 'this' is static
    b.  this = where the function is written/declared


Limitation of Arrow Function
==============================
1. Don't use arrow function as object methods.
2. Don't Use arrow function, if 'this' should be dynamic


Benefits Of Arrow
=================
1. Use arrow function, when 'this' is expected to be static
