datatypes:
=========
-Types of data we are dealing with.
-JavaScript provides different data types to hold different types of values.
-two types of data types : 
	1.primitive  	(number,string,boolean,undefined,null,symbol,bigInt)
	2.Non-primitive (object references - Object)
-difference between primitives and non-primitives is that primitives are immutable and 
 non-primitives are mutable.
	var str = 'This is a string.';
	str[1] = 'H'
	console.log(str); // 'This is a string.'
-Mutable values are those which can be modified after creation.
-Immutable values are those which cannot be modified after creation.
-primitives are compared by values whereas non-primitives are compared by references.
-primitive value will always be exactly equal to another primitive with an equivalent value.
    const first = "abc" + "def";
	const second = "ab" + "cd" + "ef";
	console.log(first === second); // true
-equivalent non-primitive values will not result in values which are exactly equal.
    const obj1 = { name: "sanjay" };
	const obj2 = { name: "sanjay" };
	console.log(obj1 === obj2); // false
-'typeof' is used to check datatype of a value.


  Primitive							Non-primitive/Complex
  --------------					-------------------------
  1. number							1. Object (Object & Array)
  2. string								
  3. boolean(true,false)
  4. undefined(undefined)
  5. null
  6. symbol(ES-6)
  7. bigint (const x = 2n ** 53n;)
     appending n to the end of an integer literal



null vs undefined
------------------
-undefined means "not initialized".it means a variable is declared but not initialized yet.
-null means "the intentional absence of any object value". null is an assigned value. It means nothing.
-A variable initialized with undefined means that the variable has no value or object assigned to it 
 while null means that the variable has been set to an object whose value is undefined.
-Both null and undefined are falsy values.
-The JSON data format does not support undefined, supports only null;
-JSON.stringify({a: undefined, b: null}) -->{"b":null}
-even though typeof null === 'object', null is a still primitive value. 
	ex: null == null;   //true


symbol
======
-Symbols are often used to add unique property keys to an object that won’t collide with keys.
-create a symbol by calling the Symbol(), not by using new keyword.
 let sym1 = Symbol()  // correct
 let sym2 = new Symbol()  // TypeError
-Even if we create many symbols with the same description, they are different values.
 Symbol('foo') === Symbol('foo')  // false
-Symbols allow us to create “hidden” properties of an object, 
 that no other part of code can accidentally access or overwrite.
-If we want to use a symbol in an object literal,we need square brackets around it.
 let id = Symbol('User Id');
 let user = {name:'sanjay',[id]:123}
-Symbols are not enumerated,Symbols are skipped by for…in while we iterate object properties.
-Symbols are not part of the Object.keys() or Object.getOwnPropertyNames()
-Symbols assigned to an object can be accessed using the Object.getOwnPropertySymbols() method
-Object.assign() copies both string and symbol properties.
