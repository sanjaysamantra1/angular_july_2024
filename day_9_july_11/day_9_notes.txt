Use Strict
==========
-provides better coding standard and stronger error checking.
-'use strict' is only recognized at the beginning of a script or a function.
-JavaScript modules are automatically in strict mode, with no statement needed to initiate it.(import/export)
-The purpose of "use strict" is to execute the javascript in "strict mode".
-when 'use strict' is not written, browser runs the JS in normal mode.
-when 'use strict' is  written, browser runs the JS in strict mode.
-Strict mode changes some previously-accepted mistakes into errors.


1. variable declaration without var/let/const is not allowed.
   makes it impossible to accidentally create global variables.
2. function with duplicate arguements are not allowed.
3. NaN/undefined/Infinity cann't be used as a variable name.
4. Delete of an unqualified identifier in strict mode. 
    ex:delete Object.prototype; 
	var x = 5; delete x;
5. Multiple assignments not allowed.
   var a = b = c = 3;
6. 'this' is undefined, when a function is invoked from Global Context in strict mode.



Variables Scopes
================
1. Global    - inside a script , anywhere in the script
2. function  - inside a function , only inside that function
3. Block     - inside a block(if,else,for,try,catch),only inside that block
