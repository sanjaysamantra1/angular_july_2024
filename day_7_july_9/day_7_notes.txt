How Javascript Works
====================
-When a javascript code is executed, N # of execution contexts are created.
-1 Global Execution context is created for every javascript program.
-For Each Function call 1 execution context is created.
-Execution context is the environment within which the current code is being executed.
-Each execution context has two phases: 
	1. creation phase. (Allocates memory - variables & functions and assign 'undefined' to variables)
	2. execution phase. (Code gets Executed - assign values to variables & method invocation)
